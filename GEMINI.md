# Project Overview

This directory contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed for learning the fundamentals of Python programming. The materials cover basic concepts, including:

*   Variables and data types (strings, numbers)
*   Data structures like lists and dictionaries
*   Conditional logic using `if` statements
*   Looping with `while` statements

## Running the Code

The code in this project is organized into individual files, each demonstrating a specific concept.

### Python Scripts (`.py`)

The Python script files (ending in `.py`) can be executed using the Python interpreter.

**Example:**
```bash
python codes/05_ifs.py
```

### Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)

The Jupyter Notebook files (ending in `.ipynb`) provide interactive examples. To run these, you need to have a Jupyter environment installed.

1.  **Install Jupyter:**
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

2.  **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

This will open a new tab in your web browser, allowing you to navigate to the `codes` directory and open any of the `.ipynb` files.

## Development Conventions

As this is a collection of learning materials, there are no strict development conventions. The primary goal of the code is to be clear and illustrative for educational purposes.
